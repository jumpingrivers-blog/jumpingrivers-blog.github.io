```{r setup,include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE)
```

## Can't be bothered reading, tell me now

Host RStudio server on an azure instance. Configure the instance to access RStudio
with a _nice_ url



## Reserving a domain

Before going any further, you need to reserve an domain name. There are numerous companies around for
reserving domain names. I've used a few, but my recommendation (following a recommendation from Dirk Eddelbuettel)
is [Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net/en). 

There are also a few places that offer "free domains". I've never used one, so can't comment

## Updating apahce: rstudio.conf
