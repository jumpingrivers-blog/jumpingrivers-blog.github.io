```

Hi all, 

from now on we're going to be running a weekly CRAN package update using the faithful [CRANberries RSS feed](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/) set up by Dirk Eddelbuettel.

Each update will contain a new R package that we think is useful and a particular package update that we think might come in handy.

## New package

Name:: **rPackedBar**
Description:: Packed bar charts are a variation of treemaps for visualizing skewed data
#### Example

The example given is populations figures of countries across the world. This data is kept within the **treemap** package. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("treemap")
```
```{r}
library("treemap")
```

We need to get the data into the form of a data table:

```{r}
data(GNI2014, package = 'treemap')
data.table::setDT(GNI2014)
(my_input_data = GNI2014[,sum(population), by=country])
```

Next we're going to use the only function in the **rPackedBar** library, `plotly_packed_bar()`. This does what it says on the tin, creates a **plotly** style packed bar chart:

```{r}
library(rPackedBar)
plotly_packed_bar(my_input_data,
                  label_column = 'country',
                  value_column = 'V1',
                  plot_title = 'Population 2014',
                  xaxis_label = 'Population',
                  hover_label = 'Population',
                  min_label_width = .025,
                  color_bar_color ='orange')
```

Personally, I think this is an excellent visualisation of "bar-chart-able" data. 

## Updated packaged 

Name:: **googleway**
Description::  Provides a mechanism to plot a Google Map from R and overlay it with shapes and markers. Also provides access to Google Maps APIs, including places, directions, roads, distances, geocoding, elevation and timezone. 
Update:: `2.2.0` to `2.4.0`

Having skipped an entire 0.1 on the update, this is a **big** update with an edit (improvement) on most functions.
