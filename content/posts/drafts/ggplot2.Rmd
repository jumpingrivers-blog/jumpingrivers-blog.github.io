## Styling ggplot2 graphics

In my [previous post](posts/2018/2018-01-24-base-r-graphics/), we demostrated that contary to popular opinion, it is possible
to generate attractive looking plots using just base graphics. Although we do confess, that it
did take a lot of time and effort.

In this post we repeat the same exercise. Using the dreaded `iris` data set, we'll first
create the default ggplot2 graph, before applying a bit of care and attention.

## The standard ggplot version

The standard scatter plot is straightforward to create. Load the package

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
```
Then create a scatter plot
```{r, fig.align="center"}
## ggplot2 even spells colour correctly ;)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = Species))
```

Unlike the base R offering, the list of things wrong with the this plot is short, basically
it's 

  * the axis labels (but they come from the column headings)
  * colours (red & blue aren't the best combination)
  
So overall, pretty good. Other aspects that could be improved are 

  * grey background
  * direct labels on the points
  * starting the x-axis at $4$ not $4.2$

## Styling the plot using only ggplot2

Using only ggplot2 (and a little bit of **dplyr** love), we can improve significantly
and easily improve the graph. First we'll capilise the legend key. I find it easier 
to manipulate the data directly,

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("dplyr")
iris = mutate(iris, Species = stringr::str_to_title(Species))
```
With data tweak, we can get to the serious business of styling the plot. As the plot
will contain a number of components it makes sense to create intermediate objects. 
Instead of using `geom_point()`, we'll switch to `geom_jitter()` which will wiggle the
values and allow us to see overlapping points:
```{r}
g = ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = Species)) + 
  xlab("Sepal length") + ylab("Sepal width") + # Improve axis labels
  ggtitle("The infamous Iris plot") # Title
g
```
The changes we've made so far would impossible for any package to do for us - how would 
the package know the plot title? We can now improve the look and feel of the plot. There 
are two ways of complentary ways of doing this: scales and themes. The ggplot scales control
things like colours and point size. In the latest version of ggplot2, version 3.0.0,
the viridis colour palette was introduced. This palette is particularly useful for 
creating colour-blind friendly palettes
```{r}m
g + scale_colour_viridis_d() # d for discrete
```
The theme controls elements such as, grid lines, fonts, labels. I'm partial to 
the `theme_minimal()`

```{r}
g + scale_colour_viridis_d() + 
  theme_minimal()
```

## The hrbrthemes package

We don't just have to use the themes that come with **ggplot2**. We can use themes
provided by other packages. The **hrbrthemes** packages contains a nice theme called
`ipsum` that is similar to the minimal theme, but also tweaks the font and allows sub-headings.
There is also an associated colour scheme called `scale_colour_ipsum()`.

We will also drop the legend and place the text directly on the chart. After 
loading the package and creating a data frame with the label positions

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("hrbrthemes")
labels = data.frame(x = c(5, 5.3, 7), y = c(4.2, 2.1, 3.7), 
                    Species = c("Setosa", "Versicolor", "Virginica"))
```
We construct the plot as usual
```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = Species)) + 
  theme_ipsum() + 
  labs(x = "Sepal length", y="Sepal width",
       title = "The infamous Iris data set",
       subtitle = "Thanks @hrbrmstr for the theme",
       caption = "jumpingrivers.com") + 
  scale_colour_ipsum(guide = FALSE) + 
  geom_text(data = labels, aes(x, y, label = Species, colour = Species)) + 
  xlim(c(4, 8))
```

Notice we can add data from two data sets onto a ggplot with relative ease.
