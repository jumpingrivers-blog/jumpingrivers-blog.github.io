## Styling ggplot2 graphics

In my [previous post](posts/2018/2018-01-24-base-r-graphics/), we demostrated that contary to popular opinion, it is possible
to generate attractive looking plots using just base graphics. Although we do confess, that it
did take a lot of time and effort.

In this post we repeat the same exercise. Using the dreaded `iris` data set, we'll first
create the default ggplot2 graph, before applying a bit of care and attention.

## The standard ggplot version

The standard scatter plot is straightforward to great. Load the package

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
```
Then create a scatter plot
```{r, fig.align="center"}
## ggplot2 even spells colour correctly ;)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = Species))
```

Unlike the base R offering, the list of things wrong with the this plot is short, basically
it's 

  * the axis labels (but they come from the column headings)
  * colours (red & blue aren't the best combination)
  
So overall, pretty good. Other aspects that could be improved are 

  * grey background
  * direct labels on the points
  * starting the x-axis at $4$ not $4.2$

## Styling the plot


```{r, message = FALSE}
library("hrbrthemes")
labels = data.frame(x = c(5, 5.3, 7), y = c(4.2, 2.1, 3.7), 
                    Species = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"))

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = Species)) + 
  theme_ipsum() + 
  labs(x="Sepal Length", y="Sepal Width",
       title="The infamous IRIS data set",
       subtitle="Thanks @hrbrmstr for the theme",
       caption="jumpingrivers.com") + 
  scale_colour_ipsum(guide = FALSE) + 
  geom_text(data = labels, aes(x, y, label = Species, colour = Species)) + 
  xlim(c(4, 8))
```


```{r, message = FALSE}

```
