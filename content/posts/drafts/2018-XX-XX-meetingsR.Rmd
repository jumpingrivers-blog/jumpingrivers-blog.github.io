For the last couple of years we maintained (well actually the community)
a list of [R-user groups and conferences](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/).
The data is stored in [GitHub](https://github.com/jumpingrivers/meetingsR) and
is free to use. Over the course of 18 months, we've had __57__ contributors that 
have added new user groups and occasionally pruned defunct groups.

A few months ago we launched a competition, in conjunction with eRum 2018, to visualise this
data and had some great submissions - see this recent [post](posts/2018/erum2018-competition-winners/)
giving details. The ultimate aim is to dynamically link the visualisations with the useR group repo, i.e.
when a new event is added, the visualisation is updated. We wanted the visualisation to be as light weight as possible,
both to encourage contributions from the community and also to make maintance easy!

Version 0.1 has been just been launched - please [try it out](https://jumpingrivers.shinyapps.io/meetingsR/)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="600"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2018/meetingsR-screenshot.png")
```

Currently the dashboard is automatically updated from the repo; this is our first priority.
