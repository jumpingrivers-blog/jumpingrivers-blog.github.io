So... big news. 

Jumping Rivers is sponsoring [eRum 2018](http://2018.erum.io/) and in light of this news we are giving away a free place at the conference! 

*(Not to mention our very own lead consultant, Colin Gillespie, is one of the invited speakers.)*

__*The competition*__

Here at Jumping Rivers, we maintain the site [meetingsR](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/). This comprises of three comprehensive lists:

1. All upcoming (and foregone) R conferences.

2. All R useR groups from around the globe. 

3. All R-Ladies groups from around the globe.

The github repo can for the website [can be found here](https://github.com/jumpingrivers/meetingsR/). 

All we are asking for is a visualisation/dashboard of meetingsR. For example, it could be a visualtion of the useR group locations, or a dashboard based on the conference costs. 

**The best one wins a free place at eRum 2018!**

To give the winner apt time to prepare for their trip to Budapest in May, the deadline will be **5pm** on **Monday 2nd April**. 

Not only that, but if we feel like the winners solution fits the meetingsR site, we'll encorporate it in the site! Credit given, of course.

Solutions should be e-mailed to *theo@jumpingrivers.com* and if possible they should be held on a public repository on something such as GitHub. 

Good luck!
