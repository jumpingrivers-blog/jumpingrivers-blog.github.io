Well well well, we've only gone and won the Water Hub hackathon! Well, joint winners but the main word is *WINNER*. First of all we want to say thank you to all the guys at the [Water Hub](http://www.thewaterhub.org.uk/) and the Sunderland Software Centre for organising and inviting. There was some tough competition there and we are thrilled to have ajudged joint top! Here's how we won:

The first day started off with presentations from Antonio Scar and Matt Starr from the enviroment agency (who we apologise profusely too for constantly harassing about their current system and data), Martin Colling from the Wear Rivers Trust and Louise Bracken of the Water Hub. Whilst we were listening to some passionate presentations about the enviroment and the problem at hand we were able to tuck into some free bacon and sausage sarnies! 

The main problems we thought the presentations established were:

1) The Enviroment Agency have created a fantastic data exploration tool with a **_TONNE_** of data available in it *but* it's a little difficult to navigate and the API documentation is difficult. The data exploration too along with all the data is available to view [here](http://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/).

2) To help the enviroment, we need to engage a wide audience and encourage people to use the available data *but* because of the difficult/scary data exploration tool it is not easy to do so.

We then established a few ways to improve this:

1) Ability to subscribe to data updates
2) Better visualisation tools
3) Ability to look at multiple regions at once

So we came up with a product to tackle these problems. In reality it's a collection of products that sit together through a single web application. The bonus of this is that is we then develop more tools they will just sit on the app without us having to completely redesign the app.

The three products that made up the app are:

1) A map giving you the ability to chose more than one area for evaluation

2) A simpler more consistent and visually appealing documentation for the API
    + The ability to explore the API in a more visual way
    + The ability to generate Example API queries in the page - (could copy and paste out to your application)

3) A bespoke reporting tool 
    + This included dynamic html based reports generated from regions and data sets of interest in the explorer
    + The ability to print these reports straight to pdf file

Here's a cheeky picture of us being winners:
