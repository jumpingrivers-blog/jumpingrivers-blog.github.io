Before we start anything, I'd like to mention that most of the hard work came from *nsaunders* and his blog post [Idle thoughts lead to R internals: how to count function arguments](https://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2018/06/22/idle-thoughts-lead-to-r-internals-how-to-count-function-arguments/amp/). 

Let's get started. 

The aim of this blog is to capture the number of arguments present in each function with packages of the **tidyverse**. First we need to load the necessary packages 

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("tidytext")
```
Now we need to grab the relevant **tidyverse** packages 
```{r}
tpkg = tidyverse_packages()
tpkg[17] = "readxl"
head(tpkg)
```
We've had to reset the 17th element to `readxl` as it gets loaded as `readxl\n(>=`, which breaks the next block of code. Now we also need to load in the tidyverse packages. Doing this one by one would be a pain, so I've gone for a for loop...
```{r, message = FALSE}
for(i in tpkg){
  library(i, character.only = TRUE)
}
```

Now, for the actual analysis I'm just going to whack the full code in now, then go through it line by line. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
pkg = tpkg %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  rename(package = value) %>%  
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(funcs = paste0(ls(paste0("package:", package)), collapse = ",")) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(func, funcs, token = stringr::str_split, 
                pattern = ",", to_lower = FALSE) %>% 
  filter(is.function(get(func, pos = paste0("package:", package)))) %>% 
  mutate(num_args = length(formalArgs(args(get(func, pos = paste0("package:", package)))))) %>% 
  ungroup()
```
This is what the head of `pkg` looks like 
```{r}
head(pkg)
```

### Lines `1-4`

Lines 1-4 look like this 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
tpkg %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  rename(package = value) %>%  
  rowwise() %>% 
```

Here we are grabbing, the tidyverse packages character vector, converting it to a tibble and renaming the column. We then use `rowwise()` so that we can work in a row-wise fashion. 

### Line 5 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(funcs = paste0(ls(paste0("package:", package)), collapse = ",")) %>% 
```

To get a character vector back of the objects within a package, we do `ls("package:package_name")`. However, we want to store this as a single string, so we need to use our old friend `paste0()` to do so. We then use mutate to attach this to the data frame. Our data from now looks like this 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tpkg %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  rename(package = value) %>%  
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(funcs = paste0(ls(paste0("package:", package)), collapse = ",")) %>% 
  head()
```

### Lines 6 - 7

```{r, eval = FALSE}
unnest_tokens(func, funcs, token = stringr::str_split, 
                pattern = ",", to_lower = FALSE) %>% 
```

As we've stored the function names as a single string, we can now apply some **tidytext** to turn our data into long data! We do this using the `unnest_tokens()` function. Here we are taking the `funcs` variable, turning it into `func` by splitting it up using `str_split()` from **stringr**. The data now looks like this 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tpkg %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  rename(package = value) %>%  
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(funcs = paste0(ls(paste0("package:", package)), collapse = ",")) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(func, funcs, token = stringr::str_split, 
                pattern = ",", to_lower = FALSE) %>% 
  head()
```

### Line 8

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(is.function(get(func, pos = paste0("package:", package)))) %>%
```

Now, not every object inside a package is a function. We can use `is.function()` to test this. However, as our function names are stored as strings, we us wrap them in the `get()` function. For instance, 

```{r}
is.function("augment")
is.function(get("augment"))
```

What if we have conflicts in function names? We can also specify the package our function is from, using the argument `pos` 

```{r}
is.function(get("augment", pos = "package:broom"))
```

We can then use this condition within a filter command to remove any objects that aren't functions


### Lines 9 - end

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(num_args = length(formalArgs(args(get(func, pos = paste0("package:", package)))))) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

It is possible to withdraw the arguments of a function using the `formalArgs()` function. However, this does not work on primitive functions
```{r}
formalArgs(get("add", pos = "package:magrittr"))
formalArgs(get("augment", pos = "package:broom"))
```

We can counter act this by wrapping the function in `args()` first. This method now works for both primitives and non-primitives

```{r}
formalArgs(args(get("add", pos = "package:magrittr")))
formalArgs(args(get("augment", pos = "package:broom")))
```

To work out the number of these argument we simply wrap this expression in `length()`. 

## The big reveal

```{r}
pkg %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_args))
```

So it turns out that `theme()` from **ggplot2** is king of the arguments, by a clear 49!  

We can go a step further and retrieve the argument names as well. To do this we use the same tecnhique as before with the functions

```{r, warning = FALSE}
pkg %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(args = paste0(formalArgs(args(get(func, pos = paste0("package:", package)))), 
                       collapse = ",")) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(arg, args, token = stringr::str_split, 
                pattern = ",", to_lower = FALSE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  count(arg) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

It's no surprise `...` and `x` are up there! We could also do this per package...

```{r, warning = FALSE}
pkg %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(args = paste0(formalArgs(args(get(func, pos = paste0("package:", package)))), 
                       collapse = ",")) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(arg, args, token = stringr::str_split, 
                pattern = ",", to_lower = FALSE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(package) %>% 
  count(arg) %>% 
  arrange(package, desc(n)) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  arrange(n) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
```
