```{r setup,include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE)
```

Hi all, so given our logo here at Jumping Rivers is a set of lines designed to look analytical and *"statsy"*, we thought it would be a neat idea to recreate this image in R. To do so we're going to need a couple packages:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("ggalt")
install.packages("readr")
```

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("ggalt")
library("readr")
```

We're also going to need the data containing the points for the lines and which set of points belongs to which line. There is a Gist available to download at the [Jumping Rivers Github](https://gist.github.com/jumpingrivers/6e88357ef28697c612bb5553251a473d). To read in the csv file we're going to use the raw data link. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
dd = read_csv("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jumpingrivers/6e88357ef28697c612bb5553251a473d/raw/3e0f42653765fd6267eee74a940cf6767de49d31/logo.csv")
head(dd)
```

The code to then produce the Jumping Rivers logo is 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(dd, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_xspline(aes(size = type), spline_shape = -0.3) + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_size_manual(values = 4:1, guide = FALSE)
```

Let's disect that code:

- `geom_xspline()` is the X-spline version of `geom_line()`, drawing a curve relative to the observations. 
  + The aesthetic setting `size = type` here is indictating we'd like the size of the lines to be relative to the type variable in our data. 
  + `spline_shape = -0.3` controls the shape of the spline relative to the observations. This can be a number between `-1` & `1`. Basically, `-1` = bumpy lines, `1` = flat lines. 
  
- `theme_void()` does what it says on the tin; gives us a theme completely void of everything. Bar the lines of course. 

- `scale_size_manual()` literally scales the size of the lines manually. 
  + `values = 4:1` is assigning a scale size to each individual line, i.e. line 1 gets scaled by 4, line 2 gets scaled 3 and so on.  
  
That's all for now. 

Thanks for reading! :)
