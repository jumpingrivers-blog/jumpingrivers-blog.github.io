<h2><a href="https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/22_r-tidyverse">Mastering the Tidyverse - 14th</a></h2>
<p>A course on the suite of R packages known as the <strong>tidyverse</strong>. The <strong>tidyverse</strong> is essential for any statistician or data scientist who deals with data on a day-to-day basis. By focusing on small key tasks, the tidyverse suite of packages removes the pain of data manipulation. You will learn how to use packages at the forefront of cutting edge data analytics such as <strong>dplyr</strong> and <strong>tidyr</strong>. Learn how to efficiently manage dates and times with <strong>lubridate</strong> and learn how to import and export data from anything from csv and excel files to SAS and SPSS files using the fantastic <strong>readr</strong>, <strong>readxl</strong> and <strong>foreign</strong> packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="next-steps-in-the-tidyverse---15th" class="section level2">
<h2><a href="https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/25_r-tidyverse-purrr-broom">Next Steps in the Tidyverse - 15th</a></h2>
<p>After mastering only half the potentialy of the tidyverse in <strong>Mastering the Tidyverse</strong>, this course will cover other <strong>tidyverse</strong> essentials. This includes the <strong>broom</strong> package, for tidying up statistical outputs. Tired of writing <em>for</em> loops? Look no further, the <strong>purrr</strong> package provides a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. Learn how to use <strong>stringr</strong>, regular expressions and <strong>tidytext</strong>, providing you with the tools for complex string and text analysis.</p>
