<p>The results of the eRum competition are in! Before we announce the winners we would like to thank everyone who entered. It has been a pleasure to look at all of the ideas on show.</p>

<h3>The Main Competition</h3>
<p>The winner of the main competition is Lukasz Janiszewski. Lukasz provided a fantastic visualisation of the locations of each R user/ladies group and all R conferences. You can see his app <a href="https://ch2m.shinyapps.io/erum_jr/">here</a>. If you want to view his code, you are able to do so in this <a href="https://github.com/lukuiR/Rpublic">GitHub repo</a>. The code is contained in the directory erum_jr and the data preparation can be seen in <code>budap.R</code>.</p>
<p>Lukasz made 3 csv files contained the information about the R user, R ladies and R conferences. Using the help of <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/osm-nominatim-with-r-getting-locations-geo-coordinates-by-its-address/">an Rbloggers post</a>, he was able to add the geospatial information to those csv files. Finally, he scraped each meetup page for information on the R-ladies groups. Using all of this information, he was able to make an informative, visually appealing dashboard with <strong>shiny</strong>.</p>
<p>Lukasz will now be jetting off to Budapest, to eRum 2018!</p>

<h3>The Secondary Competition</h3>
<p>The winner of the secondary competition is Jenny Snape. Jenny provided an excellent script to parse the current .Rmd files and extract the conference and group urls &amp; locations. The script can be found in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/jumpingrivers/a05f8ae598747be49679b0b75790f2e2">GitHub gist</a>. Jenny has written a few words to summarise her script…</p>
<p>“The files on github can be read into R as character vectors (where each line is a element of the vector) using the R <code>readLines()</code> function.</p>
<p>From this character vector, we need to extract the country, the group name and url. This can be done by recognising that each line containing a country starts with a ‘##’ and each line containing the group name and url starts with a ’*‘. Therefore we can use these ’tags’ to cycle through each element of the character vector and pull out vectors containing the countries, the cities and the urls of the R groups. These vectors can then be cleaned and joined together into a data frame.</p>
<p>I wrote these steps into a function that accepted each R group character vector as an input and returned the final data frame. As one of the data sets contained just R Ladies groups, I fed this in as an argument and returned it as a column in the final data frame in order to differentiate between the different group types. I also returned a variable based on the character vector input in order to differentiate between the different world continents.</p>
<p>Running this function on each of the character vectors creates separate data sets which can then be all joined together. This creates a final dataset containing all the information on each R group: the type of group, the url, the city and the region.&quot;</p>
<p>As well as this, Jenny provided us with a fantastic <a href="https://jennifersnape.shinyapps.io/leaflet_app/"><strong>shiny</strong> dashboard</a>, summarising the data.</p>
<p>Jenny has now received a free copy of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/?cmp=af-npa--storehome_cj_11257098_4003003">Efficient R Prgoramming</a>!</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to all who entered and well done to our winners, Lukasz and Jenny!</p>

<h3>What next?</h3>
<p>We’re in the process of converting Jenny’s &amp; Lukasz’s hard work into a nice dashboard that will magically updated via our list of <a href="https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/">useR groups</a> and conferences. It should be ready in a few days.</p>
