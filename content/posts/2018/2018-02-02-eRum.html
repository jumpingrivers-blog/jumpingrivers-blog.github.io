<p>So… big news.</p>
<p>Jumping Rivers is sponsoring <a href="http://2018.erum.io/">eRum 2018</a> and in light of this news we are giving away a free place at the conference!</p>
<p><em>(Not to mention our very own lead consultant, Colin Gillespie, is one of the invited speakers.)</em></p>
<div id="the-main-competition" class="section level2">
<h2>The Main Competition</h2>
<p>Here at <a href="https://jumpingrivers.com">Jumping Rivers</a>, we maintain the site <a href="https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/">meetingsR</a>. This comprises of three comprehensive lists:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>All upcoming (and foregone) R conferences.</p></li>
<li><p>All R useR groups from around the globe.</p></li>
<li><p>All R-Ladies groups from around the globe.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/jumpingrivers/meetingsR/">GitHub repo</a> for the contents.</p>
<p>All we are asking for is a visualisation or dashboard of meetingsR. For example, it could be a visualisation of the useR group locations, or a dashboard based on the conference costs or …</p>
<p><strong>The best one wins a free place at eRum 2018!</strong></p>
<p>To give the winner apt time to prepare for their trip to Budapest in May, the deadline will be <strong>5pm</strong> on <strong>Monday 2nd April</strong>.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if we feel like the winners solution fits the meetingsR site, we’ll incorporate it in the site! Credit given, of course.</p>
<p>Solutions should be e-mailed to <em><a href="mailto:theo@jumpingrivers.com">theo@jumpingrivers.com</a></em> and if possible they should be held on a public repository on something such as GitHub.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>The Secondary Competition</h2>
<p>Regardless of the visualisation, we’ll need an R script to parse the current <code>.Rmd</code> files and extract the conference and group urls &amp; locations. Rather than have everyone suffering parsing hell, we’ll send a free copy of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920047995.do">Efficient R Programming</a> to the first reasonable attempt at a parsing script (if we have a few scripts, we can send more than one copy).</p>
<p>Just email <em><a href="mailto:theo@jumpingrivers.com">theo@jumpingrivers.com</a></em></p>
