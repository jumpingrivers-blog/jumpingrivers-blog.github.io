Hi all, so given our logo here at Jumping Rivers is a set of lines designed to look like a Gaussian Process, we thought it would be a neat idea to recreate this image in R. To do so we're going to need a couple packages. We do the usual `install.packages()` dance (remember this step can be performed in [parallel](http://blog.jumpingrivers.com/posts/2017/speed_package_installation/))

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "ggalt", "readr"))
```

We're also going to need the data containing the points for the lines and which set of points belongs to which line. There is a Gist available to download via [Jumping Rivers](https://gist.github.com/jumpingrivers/6e88357ef28697c612bb5553251a473d). To read in the csv file we're going to use the raw data link. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
(dd = readr::read_csv("https://goo.gl/HzNbAp", col_types = "ddc"))
```

The data set contains three columns, `x`, `y` and `type`, where `type` indicates the line.
Let's start with a standard `geom_line()` 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
g = ggplot(dd, aes(x, y))
g + geom_line(aes(group = type))
```
The graph shares similarities with our logo, but is too _discrete_.  To smooth the curve, we'll 
use a function from the **ggalt** package
```{r}
library("ggalt")
g + geom_xspline(aes(group = type), spline_shape = -0.3) 
```
The function `geom_xspline()` is the X-spline version of `geom_line()`, drawing a curve relative to the observations.  
The parameter`spline_shape = -0.3` controls the shape of the spline relative to the observations. This can be a number between `-1` & `1`. Basically, `-1` = bumpy lines, `1` = flat lines. 

Next we'll change the widths of the lines

```{r}
(g1 = g  + geom_xspline(aes(size = type, group = type), spline_shape = -0.3) + 
  scale_size_manual(values = (4:1)/2, guide = FALSE))
```
The `scale_size_manual()` function enables us to control the line widths. Finally, we
remove the background
```{r}
g1 + theme_void()
```
The function`theme_void()` does what it says on the tin it gives us a theme completely void of everything. Bar the lines of course. 

That's all for now. 

Thanks for reading! :)
