## What is SatRday?

SatRdays are a collection of free/cheap accessible R conferences organised by members of the R community at various locations across the globe. Each SatRday looks to provide talks and/or workshops by R programmers covering the language and it's applications and is run as a not-for-profit event. They provide a great place to meet like minded people, be it researchers, data scientists, developers or enthusiasts, to discuss your passion for R programming.
