Big news, from the 13th til the 27th June Jumping Rivers will be running 6 courses on R in _**Hamburg!!**_. It should be noted that each course runs for one day, apart from the *Predictive Analytics* course, which runs for 2 days. The courses are as follows:

## [Introduction to R - 13th](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/0_introduction-to-r)

For this course you need *no* prior programming knowledge of any type! You will learn how to efficiently manipulate, plot, import and export data using R. 

## [Mastering the Tidyverse - 14th](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/22_r-tidyverse)

A course on the suite of R packages known as the **tidyverse**. The **tidyverse** is essential for any statistician or data scientist who deals with data on a day-to-day basis. By focusing on small key tasks, the tidyverse suite of packages removes the pain of data manipulation. You will learn how to use packages at the forefront of cutting edge data analytics such as **dplyr** and **tidyr**. Learn how to efficiently manage dates and times with **lubridate** and learn how to import and export data from anything from csv and excel files to SAS and SPSS files using the fantastic **readr**, **readxl** and **foreign** packages. 

## [Next Steps in the Tidyverse - 15th](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/25_r-tidyverse-purrr-broom)

After mastering only half the potentialy of the tidyverse in **Mastering the Tidyverse**, this course will cover other **tidyverse** essentials. This includes the **broom** package, for tidying up statistical outputs. Tired of writing *for* loops? Look no further, the **purrr** package provides a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. Learn how to use **stringr**, regular expressions and **tidytext**, providing you with the tools for complex string and text analysis.

## [Automated Reporting (First Steps Towards Shiny) - 20th](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/15_automated-reporting-first-steps-towards-shiny)

Tired of having to write a new report for every single data set? With **R Markdown**, and **knitr** you can build interactive reports, documents and dashboards that update when your data updates! 

## [Interactive Graphics with Shiny - 21st](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/12_interactive-graphics-with-shiny)

The R package **Shiny** allows you to create cutting edge, interactive web graphics and applications that react to your data in a new and innovative way. Not only that, but **shiny** provides a platform where you can host your web applications for free! 

## [Predictive Analytics - 27/28th](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/8_predictive-analytics)

You will learn about popular analytical techniques practised in industry today such as simple regression, clustering, discriminant analysis, random forests, splines and many more. Of course by the end of the day you will be able to use R to apply these methods to your data, often in *one line* of code!
