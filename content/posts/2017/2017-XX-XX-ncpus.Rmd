### The wonder of CRAN

One of the best features of R is CRAN.
When a package is submitted to CRAN, not only is it checked
under three versions of R

 * R-past, R-release and R-devel

but also three different operating systems

 * Windows, Linux and Mac (with multiple flavours of each)

CRAN also checks that the updated package doesn't break existing packages. This last part is particularly
tricky when you consider all the dependencies a package like **ggplot2** or **Rcpp** have.  Furthermore, 
it performs all these checks within 24 hours, ready for the next set packages.

What many people don't realise is that for CRAN to perform this miracle of package checking, it 
builds and checks these packages in __parallel__; so rather than installing a single 
package at a time, it checks multiple packages at once. Obviously some care has to be taken when checking/installing
packages due to the connectiveness between packages, but R takes care of these details.

### Parallel package installation: Ncpus

If you examine the help package of `?install.packages`, there's a sneaky argument called `Ncpus`. From the help page:

> Ncpus: The number of parallel processes to use for a parallel install of more than one source package.

The default value of this argument is

> Ncpus = getOption("Ncpus", 1L)

The `getOption()` part determines if the value has been set in `options()`. If no value is found, the default number of 
processes to use is `1`. If you haven't heard of `Ncpus`, it's almost certainly 1, but you can check using

```{r results-"hide"}
getOption("Ncpus", 1L)
```

### Does it work?

To test if changing the value of `Ncpus` makes a difference, we'll install the **tidyverse** package with all it's
associated dependencies.  On my machine, all packages live in a directory called `/rpackages/`, for each test below
I deleted `/rpackages/` so all **tidyverse** dependencies were reinstalled.

My machine has eight cores
```{r, eval=FALSE}
parallel::detectCores()
# [1] 8
```
So it doesn't make sense to set `Ncpus` above 8. Another point is that although R
reports that I have 8 cores, I only have 4 physical cores; the other 4 are due to hyper-threading. 
In practice, this means that I'm only likely to get at most a 6 fold speed-up.

For this experiment, I used the RStudio CRAN repository, set via
```{r}
options(repos = c("CRAN" = "https://cran.rstudio.com/"))
```
To time the installation procedure, I just use the standard `system.time()` function. 

After removing the `/rpackages/` directory, I set `Ncpus` equal to `1` and installed
the __tidyverse__ package with dependencies
```{r, eval=FALSE}
options(Ncpus = 1)
system.time(install.packages("tidyverse"))
## Time in seconds
#    user  system elapsed 
#372.252  15.468 409.364 
```
So a standard installation takes almost 7 minutes (409/60)! 

Before we go on, it's worth noting a couple of caveats:

 * This timing also includes the download time of the packages; however for simplicity
 I'm ignoring this. Downloading the packages takes around 20 seconds
 * The above number uses a sample size of 1 to estimate the time; repeating the above 
 experiment, resulted in a remarkably consistent installation time of 410 seconds.
 
Repeating this experiment with different values of `Ncpus` gives the table below:

Ncpus | elapsed | Ratio
------|---------|------
1     | 409     |  2.26
2     | 224     |  1.24
4     | 196     |  1.08
6     | 181     |  1.00

### A permanent change: `.Rprofile`

Clearly writing `options(Ncpus = 6)` before you install a package is a pain. However, you can just
add it to your `.Rprofile` file. In a future blog post, we cover the `.Rprofile` in more detail, but for the purposes
of this post, your `.Rprofile` is a file that contains R code that runs whenever R starts. You can test whether you 
have an `.Rprofile` file using the command

```{r, results="hide"}
file.exists("~/.Rprofile")
```
If you don't have an `.Rprofile` file, create one in your home area
```{r, results="hide"}
Sys.getenv("HOME")
```
Then simply add `options(Ncpus = XX)` to your file. 

The one remaining question is what value should you set `XX`. I typically set it to six since 
I have eight cores. This allows packages to be installed in parallel, while giving me a little bit
of wiggle room to check email and listen to music.

Another added benefit is that when you run `update.packages()`, packages are also updated in parallel!
