Today we are happy to announce our Stan contest. Something we feel very strongly
at Jumping Rivers is giving back to the community. We have benefited immensely from
hard work by numerous people, so when possible, we try to give something back.

This year we're sponsoring StanCon 2018. If you don't know, 

> Stan is freedom-respecting, open-source software for facilitating statistical inference at 
> the frontiers of applied statistics.

Or to put it another way, it makes Bayesian inference fast and (a bit) easier. 
[StanCon](http://mc-stan.org/events/stancon2018/) is the premier conference for all things 
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) related and this year it will take place at the [Asilomar Conference Grounds](http://www.visitasilomar.com/), a National Historic Landmark on the Monterey Peninsula right on the beach.

Our interaction with Stan is via the excellent R package, __rstan__ and the 
 [introduction to Rstan](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/13_introductions-to-bayesian-inference-using-rstan?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=stancon_comp) course we run.

### The prize

One of the benefits of sponsoring a conference, is free tickets. Unfortunately, we can't make 
StanCon this year, so we've decided to give away the ticket via a competition.

### How do I enter?

Entering the contest is straightforward. We want a nice image to use in our [introduction to Rstan](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/13_introductions-to-bayesian-inference-using-rstan?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=stancon_comp) course. This can be a cartoon, some neat looking densities, whatever you think!

For example, my first attempt at a logo resulted in 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/stan-density.png")
```

Pretty enough, but lacking something.

Once you've come up with your awesome image, simply email info@jumpingrivers.com with a link to the image. If the image was generated in R (or other language), than the associated code would be nice. The deadline is the 6th December.


### FAQ

  * Can I submit more than one image? Feel free.
  * Who owns the copyright? Our intention is to make the image [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).
  However we're happy to change the copyright to suit. The only proviso is that we can use the image for our
  __rstan__ course.
  * Another question. Contact us via the [contact page](/contact/).
