It's that time of year when we need to start thinking about what R Conferences we would like
to (and can!) attend. We've listed conferences that 


####  rstudio::conf (San Diego, USA)

The next RStudio conference is held in San Diego, and boosts top quality speakers 
from around the R world. With excellent tutorials and great talks, this is certainly one of the
top events. The estimated cost is around $200 per day, so not the cheapest options, but worthwhile.

#### SatRday (Cape Town, South Africa)

> An opportunity to hear from and network with top Researchers, Data Scientists and Developers from the R community in South Africa and beyond.

key note speakers are MaÃ«lle Salmon and Stephanie Kovalchik. This years SatRday has two tutorials, one on
package building the other on sports modelling.
