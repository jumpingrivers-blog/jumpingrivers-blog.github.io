<h3>The wonder of CRAN</h3>
<p>One of the best features of R is CRAN. When a package is submitted to CRAN, not only is it checked under three versions of R</p>
<ul>
<li>R-past, R-release and R-devel</li>
</ul>
<p>but also three different operating systems</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows, Linux and Mac (with multiple flavours of each)</li>
</ul>
<p>CRAN also checks that the updated package doesn’t break existing packages. This last part is particularly tricky when you consider all the dependencies a package like <strong>ggplot2</strong> or <strong>Rcpp</strong> have. Furthermore, it performs all these checks within 24 hours, ready for the next set packages.</p>
<p>What many people don’t realise is that for CRAN to perform this miracle of package checking, it builds and checks these packages in <strong>parallel</strong>; so rather than installing a single package at a time, it checks multiple packages at once. Obviously some care has to be taken when checking/installing packages due to the connectiveness between packages, but R takes care of these details.</p>

<div id="parallell-package-installation-ncpus" class="section level3">
<h3>Parallell package installation: Ncpus</h3>
<p>If you examine the help package of <code>?install.packages</code>, there’s a sneaky argument called <code>Ncpus</code>. From the help page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ncpus: The number of parallel processes to use for a parallel install of more than one source package.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default value of this argument is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ncpus = getOption(“Ncpus”, 1L)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>getOption()</code> part determines if the value has been set in <code>options()</code>. If no value is found, the default number of processes to use is <code>1</code>. If you haven’t heard of <code>Ncpus</code>, it’s almost certainly 1, but you can check using</p>
<pre class="r"><code>getOption(&quot;Ncpus&quot;, 1L)
## [1] 6</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="does-it-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Does it work?</h3>
<p>To test if changing the value of <code>Ncpus</code> makes a difference, we’ll install the <strong>tidyverse</strong> package with all it’s associated dependencies. On my machine, all packages live in a directory called <code>/rpackages/</code>, for each test below I deleted <code>/rpackages/</code> so all <strong>tidyverse</strong> dependencies were reinstalled.</p>
<p>My machine has eight cores</p>
<pre class="r"><code>parallel::detectCores()
# [1] 8</code></pre>
<p>So it doesn’t make sense to set <code>Ncpus</code> above 8. Another point is that although R reports that I have 8 cores, I only have 4 physical cores; the other 4 are due to hyper-threading. In practice, this means that I’m only likely to get at most a 6 fold speed-up.</p>
<p>For this experiment, I used the RStudio CRAN repository, set via</p>
<pre class="r"><code>options(repos = c(&quot;CRAN&quot; = &quot;https://cran.rstudio.com/&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>To time the installation procedure, I just use the standard <code>system.time()</code> function.</p>
<p>After removing the <code>/rpackages/</code> directory, I set <code>Ncpus</code> equal to <code>1</code> and installed the <strong>tidyverse</strong> package with dependencies</p>
<pre class="r"><code>options(Ncpus = 1)
system.time(install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;))
## Time in seconds
#    user  system elapsed 
#372.252  15.468 409.364 </code></pre>
<p>So a standard installation takes almost 7 minutes (409/60)!</p>
<p>Before we go on, it’s worth noting a couple of caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>This timing also includes the download time of the packages; however for simplicity I’m ignoring this. Downloading the packages takes around 20 seconds</li>
<li>The above number uses a sample size of 1 to estimate the time; repeating the above experiment, resulted in a remarkably consistent installation time of 410 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeating this experiment with different values of <code>Ncpus</code> gives the table below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Ncpus</th>
<th>elapsed</th>
<th>Ratio</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>409</td>
<td>2.26</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>4</td>
<td>196</td>
<td>1.08</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>6</td>

</tbody>

<h3>A permanent change: <code>.Rprofile</code></h3>
<p>Clearly writing <code>options(Ncpus = 6)</code> before you install a package is a pain. However, you can just add it to your <code>.Rprofile</code> file. In a future blog post, we cover the <code>.Rprofile</code> in more detail, but for the purposes of this post, your <code>.Rprofile</code> is a file that contains R code that runs whenever R starts. You can test whether you have an <code>.Rprofile</code> file using the command</p>
<pre class="r"><code>file.exists(&quot;~/.Rprofile&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>If you don’t have an <code>.Rprofile</code> file, create one in your home area</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Sys.getenv(&quot;HOME&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then simply add <code>options(Ncpus = XX)</code> to your file.</p>
<p>The one remaining question is what value should you set <code>XX</code>. I typically set it to six since I have eight cores. This allows packages to be installed in parallel, while giving me a little bit of wiggle room to check email and listen to music.</p>
<p>Another added benefit is that when you run <code>update.packages()</code>, packages are also updated in parallel!</p>
