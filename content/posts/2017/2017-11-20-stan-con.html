<blockquote>
<p>Stan is freedom-respecting, open-source software for facilitating statistical inference at the frontiers of applied statistics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or to put it another way, it makes Bayesian inference fast and (a bit) easier.</p>
<p><a href="http://mc-stan.org/events/stancon2018/">StanCon</a> is the premier conference for all things <a href="http://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a> related and this year it will take place at the <a href="http://www.visitasilomar.com/">Asilomar Conference Grounds</a>, a National Historic Landmark on the Monterey Peninsula right on the beach.</p>

<h4>RStan and other interfaces</h4>
<p>One of the great features about Stan is that you can use Stan via R (or Python or â€¦). The <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started"><strong>rstan</strong></a> package can be in installed in the usual way</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;rstan&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and has been around for a few years, so is fairly stable. The easiest way to get started is to check out the rstan <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started">wiki</a> page, which gives a couple of worked through examples.</p>

<h4>Training</h4>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about Stan, we run a two day <a href="https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/13_introductions-to-bayesian-inference-using-rstan?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=stancon2018">introduction to Rstan</a> course. The course covers</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Bayesian inference: A brief overview of the main ideas behind Bayesian inference.</li>
<li>Markov chain Monte Carlo methods: A brief overview of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian computation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</li>
<li>The Stan language: An outline of the main components of a Stan program.</li>
<li>Using RStan: A guide to the use of the R interface to Stan.</li>
<li>Examples: Including linear regression, Poisson regression and hierarchical models</li>
</ul>
