In last weeks [post](posts/2017/upcoming_r_conference_2017/) we tantalised you with upcoming R &
data science conferences, but from a cost point view, not all R conferences are the same.
Using the R [conference](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/) site, it's fairly 
easy to compare the cost of previous R conferences.

I selected the main conferences over the last few years and
obtained the cost for the full ticket (including any tutorial days, but ignoring
any discounts). Next, I converted all prices to dollars and calculated the cost per day.

```{r echo=FALSE}
conf_knitr = conf
colnames(conf_knitr) = c("Conference", "Cost ($)", "#Days", "$ per day")
knitr::kable(conf_knitr)
```

The conferences fall into two camps _business oriented_ and more _general_
R conferences; useR! is somewhere in the middle. A simple bar plot highlights
the extreme difference in cost per day

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(conf) + 
  geom_col(aes(conf, per)) +
  theme_ipsum_rc(grid="X") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x="Conference", y="Cost per day ($)",
       title="Conference cost per day incl tutorials",
       subtitle="Industry ticket for the full conference",
       caption="jumpingrivers.com")
```

I think the organisers of [eRum](http://erum.ue.poznan.pl/) and [SatRdays](http://satrdays.org/capetown2017/) should be proud of themselves
for keeping the cost down; it would also be really useful if the organisers
wrote a blog post giving more general tips for keeping the cost down.

I'm going to resist commenting on the conferences since I have only ever
attended useR! (which is excellent), but in terms of speakers, most conferences
have the same keynotes, so this year I'll be looking at [eRum](http://2018.erum.io/) 2018 (sadly useR! is a bit too far away from me).
