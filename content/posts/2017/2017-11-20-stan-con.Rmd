Or to put it another way, it makes Bayesian inference fast and (a bit) easier.

[StanCon](http://mc-stan.org/events/stancon2018/) is the premier conference for all things 
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) related and this year it will take place at the [Asilomar Conference Grounds](http://www.visitasilomar.com/), a National Historic Landmark on the Monterey Peninsula right on the beach.

#### RStan and other interfaces

One of the great features about Stan is that you can use Stan via R (or Python or ...). 
The [__rstan__](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) package can be in installed in the usual
way
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rstan")
```
and has been around for a few years, so is fairly stable.
The easiest way to get started is to check out the rstan [wiki](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)
page, which gives a couple of worked through examples.

#### Training

If you are interested in learning more about Stan, we run a two day [introduction to Rstan](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/13_introductions-to-bayesian-inference-using-rstan?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=stancon2018)
course. The course covers

  * Introduction to Bayesian inference: A brief overview of the main ideas behind Bayesian inference.
  * Markov chain Monte Carlo methods: A brief overview of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian computation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
  * The Stan language: An outline of the main components of a Stan program.
  * Using RStan: A guide to the use of the R interface to Stan.
  * Examples: Including linear regression, Poisson regression and hierarchical models

Space is limited.
