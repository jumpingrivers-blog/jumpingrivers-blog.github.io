<p>Today we are happy to announce our Stan contest. Something we feel very strongly at Jumping Rivers is giving back to the community. We have benefited immensely from hard work by numerous people, so when possible, we try to give something back.</p>
<p>This year we’re sponsoring StanCon 2018. If you don’t know,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stan is freedom-respecting, open-source software for facilitating statistical inference at the frontiers of applied statistics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or to put it another way, it makes Bayesian inference fast and (a bit) easier. <a href="http://mc-stan.org/events/stancon2018/">StanCon</a> is the premier conference for all things <a href="http://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a> related and this year it will take place at the <a href="http://www.visitasilomar.com/">Asilomar Conference Grounds</a>, a National Historic Landmark on the Monterey Peninsula right on the beach.</p>
<p>Our interaction with Stan is via the excellent R package, <strong>rstan</strong> and the <a href="https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/13_introductions-to-bayesian-inference-using-rstan?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=stancon_comp">introduction to Rstan</a> course we run.</p>

<h3>The prize</h3>
<p>One of the benefits of sponsoring a conference, is free tickets. Unfortunately, we can’t make StanCon this year, so we’ve decided to give away the ticket via a competition.</p>

<h3>How do I enter?</h3>
<p>Entering the contest is straightforward. We want a nice image to use in our <a href="https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/13_introductions-to-bayesian-inference-using-rstan?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=stancon_comp">introduction to Rstan</a> course. This can be a cartoon, some neat looking densities, whatever you think!</p>
<p>For example, my first attempt at a logo resulted in</p>
<p><img src="/img/2017/stan-density.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Pretty enough, but lacking something.</p>
<p>Once you’ve come up with your awesome image, simply email <a href="mailto:info@jumpingrivers.com">info@jumpingrivers.com</a> with a link to the image. If the image was generated in R (or other language), than the associated code would be nice. The deadline is the 6th December.</p>
