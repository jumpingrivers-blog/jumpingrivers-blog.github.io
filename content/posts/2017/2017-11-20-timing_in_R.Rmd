```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE)
```

As time goes on, your R scripts are probably getting longer and more complicated, _right_? Timing parts of your script could save you precious time when re-running code over and over again. Today I'm going to go through the 4 main functions for doing so. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="300"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/front_timing.png") 
```

## Nested timings

### 1) `Sys.time()`

`Sys.time()` takes a "snap-shot" of the current time and so it can be used to record start and end times of code.

```{r}
start_time = Sys.time()
Sys.sleep(0.5)
end_time = Sys.time()
```
To calculate the difference, we just use a simple subtraction
```{r}
end_time - start_time
```

Notice it creates a neat little message for the time difference.

### 2) The tictoc package

You can install the `CRAN` version of __tictoc__ via 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tictoc")
```
whilst the most recent development is available via [the __tictoc__ GitHub page](https://github.com/collectivemedia/tictoc).
```{r}
library("tictoc")
```

Like `Sys.time()`, __tictoc__ also gives us ability to nest timings within code. However, we now have some more options to customise our timing. At it's most basic it acts like `Sys.time()`:
```{r}
tic()
Sys.sleep(0.5)
toc()
```

Now for a more contrived example. 
```{r}
# start timer for the entire section, notice we can name sections of code
tic("total time") 
# start timer for first subsection
tic("Start time til half way")
Sys.sleep(2)
# end timer for the first subsection, log = TRUE tells toc to give us a message
toc(log = TRUE)
```
Now to start the timer for the second subsection

```{r}
tic("Half way til end")
Sys.sleep(2)
# end timer for second subsection
toc(log = TRUE)
# end timer for entire section
toc(log = TRUE)
```
We can view the results as a list (`format = TRUE` returns this list in a nice format), rather than raw code
```{r}
tic.log(format = TRUE)
```
We can also reset the log via
```{r}
tic.clearlog()
```

## Comparing functions

### 1) `system.time()`

Why oh WHY did R choose to give `system.time()` a lower case `s` and `Sys.time()` and upper case `s`? 
Anyway... `system.time()` can be used to time functions without having to take note of the start and end times. 
```{r}
system.time(Sys.sleep(0.5))
system.time(Sys.sleep(1))
```
We only want to take notice of the "elapsed" time, for the definition of the "user" and "system" times see [this thread.](http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Meaning-of-proc-time-td2303263.html#a2306691) 

For a repeated timing, we would use the `replicate()` function. 
```{r}
system.time(replicate(10, Sys.sleep(0.1)))
```

### 2) The microbenchmark package

You can install the `CRAN` version of __microbenchmark__ via
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("microbenchmark")
```
Alternatively you can install the latest update via [the __microbenchmark__ GitHub page.](https://github.com/olafmersmann/microbenchmark)
```{r}
library("microbenchmark")
```

At it's most basic, `microbenchmark()` can we used to time single pieces of code.

```{r}
microbenchmark(Sys.sleep(0.1), times = 10, unit = "s")
# times = 10 tells microbenchmark to repeat the test 10 times
# unit = "s" tells microbenchmark to return the output in seconds
```

Notice we get a nicely formatted table of summary statistics. We can record our times in anything from seconds to nanoseconds(!!!!). Already this is better than `system.time()`. Not only that, but we can compare sections of code in an easy-to-do way and name the sections of code for an easy-to-read output. 

```{r}
sleep = microbenchmark(sleepy = Sys.sleep(0.1), 
                       sleepier = Sys.sleep(0.2),
                       sleepiest = Sys.sleep(0.3),
                       times = 10, 
                       unit = "s")
```

As well as this (more?!) __microbenchmark__ comes with a two built-in plotting functions.

```{r}
microbenchmark:::autoplot.microbenchmark(sleep)
microbenchmark:::boxplot.microbenchmark(sleep)
```

These provide quick and efficient ways of visualising our timings. 

***

## Conclusion

`Sys.time()` and `system.time()` have there place, but for most cases we can do better. 
The __tictoc__ and __microbenchmark__ packages are particularly useful and make it easy to store timings for later use, and the range of options for both packages stretch far past the options for `Sys.time()` and `system.time()`. 
The built-in plotting functions are handy.

Thanks for chatting!
