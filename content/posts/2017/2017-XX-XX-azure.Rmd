## Can't be bothered reading, tell me now

Host RStudio server on an azure instance. Configure the instance to access RStudio
with a _nice_ url

## Getting started

[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) is cloud computing framework provided by Microsoft, the same idea
as AWS by Amazon. In this post, we'll describe how to use Azure to run 
[RStudio Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/) in the cloud.

Unfortunately, things don't start well - Microsoft have made an endurance test of getting started with Azure.
The first stop is the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) web-page. On this page

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="800"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/azure_home.png") 
```

click on __Free Account__ and follow the instructions. This is a bit of painful process that will
require

 * Email confirmation
 * Text confirmation
 * Credit Card confirmation
 
Eventually you should get to the dashboard page!

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="800"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/azure_dashboard.png") 
```

Clicking on `Create Resources` will take you to the marketplace

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="800"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/azure_marketplace.png") 
```

Selecting `Ubuntu Server` will launch a dialogue box with four steps:

  * Step 1: Basics: configuration settings
    - __Name__: A name for the virtual machine, e.g. `rstudio`
    - __User name__: The master user who will have `sudo` access, e.g. `userX`
    - __Authentication type__: Either choose ssh or enter a password
    - __Resource group__: Since this your first instance, create a new one, say `rstudio-group`
    - __Location__: where will your machine be located
    
  * Step 2: Virtual machine size
    - Select the machine you want. Choose the smallest for the purposes of this exercise
  * Step 3: Settings
    - Nothing to change here
  * Step 4: Summary
    - Click create and we're good to go!
    
After around a minute or so, your virtual machine will be ready.

## Setting up R

The next step is to `ssh` into your instance. On the dashboard screen, click on the new box 
that shows your virtual machine. Select `Networking`. Near the top of the screen will be
a Public IP address, of the form: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX. In my instance, the IP address is
52.233.194.195


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="800"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/azure_networking.png") 
```

Make a note of your address. Next `ssh` into your instance via
```
ssh userX@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
```
To ensure that ubuntu is up-to-date on our virtual machine, we invoke super sudo powers. First we update the list of ubuntu packages
```
sudo apt-get update
```
Then we upgrade as necessary
```
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
Now we get on with the business of installing R. To use the latest version we need to add
a new [repository](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html)
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/rrutter
```
Then update again and install base R
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install r-base
```
Depending on what R packages you want to install it's worth installing a couple of other things at this
point
```
sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev # igraph
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev # Graphics packages
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev #httr
```
With an eye to the future it's also worth installing `apache2` to help with redirects
```
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

## Opening ports ready for RStudio

Whenever you access a web-page, the browser specifies a _port_. For standard http pages, 
we use port 80, for secure https pages, we use port 443. For example, when we type
```
https://www.jumpingrivers.com
```
in the browser, this is converted to 
```
https://www.jumpingrivers.com:443
```
By default our azure instance only has port 22 open (the port used for ssh communication). To access RStudio, we'll 
need to open the following ports

 * 80 (for http)
 * 443 (for https); only required if we implement SSL
 * 8787 - the default RStudio port. In the last section, we'll remove this, but just now it's handy to have it open for testing.
 
Under `Networking`, click `Add inbound port rule` and add the three ports (80, 443, 8787):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="800"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/azure_dashboard_port.png") 
```

If everything is working, you should be able to enter `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` in your browser and you'll
see the `Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page` with the title. __It works!__

## Installing RStudio

[Installing RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/) server is now relatively easy:
```
# Check the above link for updates to the version
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
wget https://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-1.1.383-amd64.deb
sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.1.383-amd64.deb
```
If everything works correctly, you should be able to view rstudio server via
```
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:8787
```
If the page _hangs_, double check you have opened port 8787 under the network settings.

## Nicer URLs

The first step is to access the page via a standard URL and not an IP address. 
In the main dashboard screen, under all resources, click on 
```
rstudio-ip Public IP address
```
Then select configuration. In the text box under DNS Label, enter text, e.g. `rstudio-myname`. So in my case, 
I have used `rstudio-jumpingrivers`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="800"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/azure_dashboard_ip.png") 
```

This means we can now access RStudio via
```
rstudio-jumpingrivers.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com:8787
```
Getting users to type the port number isn't ideal. What we would like is for users to 
type
```
rstudio-jumpingrivers.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/rstudio
```

This involves configuring Apache. First navigate to `/etc/apache2/sites-available`, e.g.
```
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
```
Next create a file called `rstudio.conf`. Using your favourite text editor, e.g. vim or nano.
Note that this file is very much space sensitive, so check it carefully.

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerAdmin info@jumpingrivers.com
  ServerName rstudio-jumpingrivers.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
  ServerAlias www.rstudio-jumpingrivers.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
  <Proxy *>
    Allow from localhost
  </Proxy>

  # Specify path for Logs
  ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
  CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
  RewriteEngine on

  # Following lines should open rstudio directly from the url
  # Map rstudio to rstudio/
  RedirectMatch ^/rstudio$ /rstudio/

  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket
  RewriteRule /rstudio/(.*) ws://localhost:8787/$1 [P,L]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade}     !=websocket
  RewriteRule /rstudio/(.*) http://localhost:8787/$1 [P,L]
  ProxyPass /rstudio/     http://localhost:8787/
  ProxyPassReverse /rstudio/ http://localhost:8787/
  ProxyRequests off
</VirtualHost>
```
Then enable the necessary Apache modules
```
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod proxy_html
sudo a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
sudo a2enmod rewrite
```
Finally, restart Apache
```
sudo a2ensite rstudio.conf
sudo service apache2 restart  
```
You should now be able to access RStudio via
```
rstudio-jumpingrivers.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/rstudio/
```

## Adding SSL

In theory it should be straightforward to add SSL support using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). 
However, I've found that you hit rate limiters since the domain is azure.com. However, if we register
our own domain, we can easily add SSL support. This will be the subject of our next blog post.
