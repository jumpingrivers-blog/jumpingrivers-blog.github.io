### Overview

[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) is cloud computing framework provided by Microsoft, the same idea
as AWS by Amazon. In the next series, we see how it is possible to use Azure to run 
RStudio in the cloude.

### Getting started

Unfortunately, we don't start well. Microsoft have made an endurance test of getting started with Azure.
The first stop is the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) web-page. On the page it 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="800"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/azure_home.png") 
```
After clicking on the __Free Account__, you should sign up for Azure. This is a bit of painful process that will
require

 * Email confirmation
 * Text confirmation
 * Credit Card confirmation
 
Eventually, you should get to the dashboard page!
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="800"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/azure_dashboard.png") 
```
Clicking on `Create Resources`, this will take you to the marketplace
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="800"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/2017/azure_marketplace.png") 
```

Selecting `Ubuntu Server` will launch a dialoge box with four steps:

  * Step 1: Basics: configuration settings
    - __Name__: A name for the virtual machine, e.g. `rstudio`
    - __User name__: The master user who will have `sudo` access
    - __Authentication type__: Either choose ssh or enter a password
    - __Resource group__: Since this your first instance, create a new one, say `rstudio-group`
    - __Location__: where will your machine be located
    
  * Step 2: Virtual machine size
    - Select the machine you want. Choose the smallest for the purposes of this exercise
  * Step 3: Settings
    - Nothing to change here
  * Step 4: Summary
    - Click create and we're good to go!
    
After around a minute or so, your virtual machine will be ready.
